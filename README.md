# YukawaTheory


This repository provides code and example usage of yukawa theory data. 
It strongly builds on [2003.101504](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.094507).

We provide lattice data generated with a HMC algorithm [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kK4OLqhwGOCZuVmkXK2sYzNZ-gWjSvVJ/view?usp=sharing).
To get started download the dataset from the GDrive link above and copy it to the cloned GitHub Repository.
Then open the mainTrainModel.py script and train your first model.

In the near future we plan to release all code necessary to reproduce [2003.101504](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.094507) directly.
